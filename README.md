Scripts for bitburner
 
- listMusic.bat is used to get a file called "listMusicBitburner.txt" with a list of your music, pass your music folder as argument
- computerMusic.js plays that music in bitburner! the first time you use it you need to pass the full path "listMusicBitburner.txt"
- ~download.js force download all bitburner .js and .script, if you have some scripts with "_" rename or you will have extra folders and your script name will change~
- ~order.bat order the scripts in the correct folders~
they finally added a "export script button", nice
